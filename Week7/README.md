# WEEK 3 README

This folder contains four subfolders: Data, were we store the data used in our code;
Code, were we have the writen code; Sandbox, were we store everything that is not
Data or Code; and Results, where all the results of our code go to.

## Code
1. `Draw.py` - Draw network from class notes
2. `LV1.py` - Integrates the Lotka-Volterra model and outputs a time series plot with the evolution of both sppecies, as well as a phase diagram.
3. `LV2.py` - Integrates the Lotka-Volterra model with a modified prey-density dependence and outputs a time series plot with the evolution of both species, as long as a phase diagram
4. `LV3.py` - Discrete time version of `LV2.py`.
5. `LV4.py` - Discrete version of `LV2.py` with random gaussian fluctuation in the resource growth
6. `Nets.R` - Generates a network plot to be reproduced with python
7. `Nets_R.py` - Reproduction of the R network plot with python
8. `Test.R` - Auxiliary R file to be called from python
9. `TestR.py` - Calling R files from python9 
10. `blackbirds.py` - Regex exercise
11. `fmr.R` - Auxiliary R file to be called from python
12. `profileme.py` - Auxiliary function that will be profiled
13. `profileme2.py` - Auxiliary function to be profiled
14. `regex.py` - Regex practice
15. `run_LV.sh` - Runing LV1 and LV2 with the profiling option on, Save results to profiling.txt
16. `run_fm_r.py` - Run an .R file from python and print in screen the R console output, as well as wether the run was succesful or not
17. `using_os.py` - Find directories and files that satisfy certain conditions using subprocess

## Data
1. `NagyEtAl1999.csv` - Data containing information of metabolic rate and body mass
2. `QMEE_Net_Mat_nodes.csv` - Information on the nodes of ICL colaborations with other entities
3. `QMEE_Net_Mat_edges.csv` - Information on the edges of ICL colaborations with other entities
4. `blackbirds.txt` - Data containing information on species, kingdom, phylum of birds.

## Sandbox
1. `sympy.ipynb` - Python notebook on symbolic calculus
