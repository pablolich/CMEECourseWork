# Week 6 README

This folder contains three subfolders: Data, were we store the data used in our code; Code, were we have the writen code; and Sandbox, were we store everything that is not Data or Code.

## Genomics and Bioinformatics 
1. An understanding of genomic data collection methods, and how to choose the data collection technique most appropriate to your question. 
2. An understanding of the wealth of data available to biologists in public genomic databases.
3. An understanding of how genetic structure develops within and between populations, how to characterise it, and how to interpret the results of common analyses such as STRUCTURE and PCA. 
4. An understanding of how demographic history affects genomic variation, and how to infer past population expansions and contractions from genomic data.
5. An understanding of how migration affects genomic variation, and how patterns of gene flow can be inferred from genomic data.
6. An understanding of how natural selection affects genomic variation, and how selection can be identified from genomic data
7. An understanding of how phylogenetic relationships among species can be inferred, and what this information can tell us about evolution and conservation efforts.
