# Week 8 README

This folder contains three subfolders: Data, were we store the data used in our code; Code, were we have the writen code; and Sandbox, were we store everything that is not Data or Code.

## High Performance Computing
1. Develop an advanced understanding of programming in R by tackling some more difficult prob- lems.
2. Learn the principles of using High Performance Computing (HPC) to crack otherwise intractable computational problems.
3. The computational problems studied in class are chosen to have relevance to ecology and evolu- tion so students will also learn about some new areas of biology along the way:
	1. Applying ecological neutral theory and individual based models of community assembly
	2. Understanding fractal geometry and its relevance in biology
