    	Why can I fit my logged data with the same model I fit my linear data in the logistic model? How can I see what is the new meaning of my parameters? Show him jmy calculations to see that it is actually that. If correct, I should apply this transformation in the parameters to only those models which are thought to be fitted in linear space: a.k.a. Logistic, gompertz, buchannan, exponential. The only ones that have been built in log space are baranyi and exponential lag.

    	When I log data, some of it is of the form 0.6..., which gives me negative logarithm values. To calculate mu_max from there is a pain
# Things to do 

## Priority 1
	0. Fix calling models to t_eval them, so that it is an iterative process. Also change the way we give the parameters to them. Now they are lists.
	1. Fix the logistic model to also fit negative numbers.
	9. Clean up code
		0. Get rid of fits[][]
		1. unpack value of params automatically with v = params.valuesdict()
    		2. Comment
	4. Write mathematical introduction to the models.
	5. DOCSTRINGS!
	7. Modularize code. Organize flow and move functions together if they are similar etc.
	8. Change color of columns in my success report based on the model. Eliminate sides of tiles so it looks cleaner.
	8. Modify init_vals code so that if lam_init turns out to be negative, the fit repeats until it is by eliminating the last and first (simetrically?) points from the data we use to fit.
	8. Modify init_vals to adress the fact that the slope is too vertical!
	8. Identify the threshold for mu_max over which baranyi yields nans, and limitate it. So far I know that mu_max = 44 and t = 22, doesnt work for a certain time.

	

## Priority 2
	1. Fit the model that accounts for death of bacteria (Peleg, 2009; Baranyi, 1996)
