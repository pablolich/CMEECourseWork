abstract = {The lag time of Listeria monocytogenes growing under suboptimal conditions (low nutrient concentrations, pH 6, and 6.5°C) was extended when the inoculum was severely stressed by starvation and the inoculum size was very small. Predictive microbiology should deal with bacterial stress and stochastic approaches to improve its value for the agro-food industry. In predictive microbiology, it is commonly assumed that inoculum size has no effect on subsequent microbial growth, and some studies (8, 9, 10) have confirmed this for growth of Listeria monocytogenes. However, Gay et al. (12) observed that inoculum size could have an effect on the duration of the lag phase of L. monocytogenes under particular conditions simulating soft cheese ripening. This observation could challenge the validity of predictive models because growth modelling is usually done with initial concentrations of bacteria higher than 10 3 CFU ml 1 , even though foods are usually contaminated with lower numbers of cells. It has been shown with other bacteria, like Bacillus (19), Achromobacter delmarvae, Micrococcus luteus (see reference 16 for review), and Salmonella (26), that the duration of the lag phase depends inversely on the size of the inoculum. This phenomenon was observed only under a restricted range of conditions, for example, in poor but not in rich media, with starved cells (16), or with heat-injured cells (26). The aim of this work was to study the effect of inoculum size on the lag phase of L. monocytogenes growing in a poor medium, i.e., broth, containing only 1 g of Bacto Peptone (Difco Laboratories , Detroit, Mich.) per liter plus 0.85{\%} sodium chloride (Pro-labo, Paris, France) (TS), under suboptimal conditions: pH 6 and 6.5°C and with cells stressed by starvation. L. monocytogenes Scott A maintained on tryptone-soya agar (Oxoid, Unipath, Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) at 4°C was subcultured onto tryptone-soya agar (Oxoid) plus 0.6{\%} yeast extract (AES, Combourg, France) (TSYE) at 37°C for 24 h, and five colonies were transferred into TSYE broth and incubated at 30°C for 24 h. This culture was used to inoculate TSYE broth to prepare inocula at 30°C. The change in viable count of L. monocytogenes in TSYE broth at 30°C determined on nonselective TSYE agar and selective Palcam (Oxoid) agar is shown in Fig. 1. The percentage of injured cells was determined by differential counts on selective and nonse-lective media (24). Inocula were prepared at 30°C for 14, 160, and 840 h to obtain cells in late log phase, early stationary phase after a decrease in cell viability of 96.8{\%} viable cells and 35{\%} injured cells and late stationary phase with a loss of viability of 99.9{\%} and 21{\%} injured cells (Fig.},

@article{Krenek2011,
abstract = {The ongoing climate change has motivated numerous studies investigating the temperature response of various organisms, especially that of ectotherms. To correctly describe the thermal performance of these organisms, functions are needed which sufficiently fit to the complete optimum curve. Surprisingly, model-comparisons for the temperature-dependence of population growth rates of an important ectothermic group, the protozoa, are still missing. In this study, temperature reaction norms of natural isolates of the freshwater protist Paramecium caudatum were investigated, considering nearly the entire temperature range. These reaction norms were used to estimate thermal performance curves by applying a set of commonly used model functions. An information theory approach was used to compare models and to identify the best ones for describing these data. Our results indicate that the models which can describe negative growth at the high- and low-temperature branch of an optimum curve are preferable. This is a prerequisite for accurately calculating the critical upper and lower thermal limits. While we detected a temperature optimum of around 29 °C for all investigated clonal strains, the critical thermal limits were considerably different between individual clones. Here, the tropical clone showed the narrowest thermal tolerance, with a shift of its critical thermal limits to higher temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {The second edition of this book is unique in that it focuses on methods for making formal statistical inference from all the models in an a priori set (Multi-Model Inference). A philosophy is presented for model-based data analysis and a general strategy outlined for the analysis of empirical data. The book invites increased attention on a priori science hypotheses and modeling. Kullback-Leibler Information represents a fundamental quantity in science and is Hirotugu Akaike's basis for model selection. The maximized log-likelihood function can be bias-corrected as an estimator of expected, relative Kullback-Leibler information. This leads to Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) and various extensions. These methods are relatively simple and easy to use in practice, but based on deep statistical theory. The information theoretic approaches provide a unified and rigorous theory, an extension of likelihood theory, an important application of information theory, and are objective and practical to employ across a very wide class of empirical problems. The book presents several new ways to incorporate model selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of precision. An array of challenging examples is given to illustrate various technical issues. This is an applied book written primarily for biologists and statisticians wanting to make inferences from multiple models and is suitable as a graduate text or as a reference for professional analysts.},

@article{Baranyi1994,
abstract = {A new member of the family of growth models described by Baranyi et al. (1993a) is introduced in which the physiological state of the cells is represented by a single variable. The duration of lag is determined by the value of that variable at inoculation and by the post-inoculation environment. When the subculturing procedure is standardized, as occurs in laboratory experiments leading to models, the physiological state of the inoculum is relatively constant and independent of subsequent growth conditions. It is shown that, with cells with the same pre-inoculation history, the product of the lag parameter and the maximum specific growth rate is a simple transformation of the initial physiological state. An important consequence is that it is sufficient to estimate this constant product and to determine how the environmental factors define the specific growth rate without modelling the environment dependence of the lag separately. Assuming that the specific growth rate follows the environmental changes instantaneously, the new model can also describe the bacterial growth in an environment where the factors, such as temperature, pH and aw, change with time. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Body size determines key behavioral and life history traits across species, as well as interactions between individuals within and between species. Therefore, variation in sizes of immigrants, by exerting variation in trophic interaction strengths, may drive the trajectory and outcomes of community assembly. Here, I study the effects of size variation in the immigration pool on assembly dynamics and equilibrium distributions of sizes and consumer-resource size-ratios using a general mathematical model. I find that because small sizes both, improve the ability to invade and destabilize the community, invasibility and stability pull body size distributions in opposite directions, favoring an increase in both size and size-ratios during assembly, and ultimately yielding a right-skewed size and a symmetric size-ratio distribution. In many scenarios, the result at equilibrium is a systematic increase in body sizes and size-ratios with trophic level. Thus these patterns in size structure are 'signatures' of dynamically constrained, non-neutral community assembly. I also show that for empirically feasible distributions of body sizes in the immigration pool, immigration bias in body sizes cannot counteract dynamical constraints during assembly and thus signatures emerge consistently. I test the theoretical predictions using data from nine terrestrial and aquatic communities and find strong evidence that natural communities do indeed exhibit such signatures of dynamically constrained assembly. Overall, the results provide new measures to detect general, non-neutral patterns in community assembly dynamics, and show that in general, body size is dominant trait that strongly influences assembly and recovery of natural communities and ecosystems.},

Microbiologists have attempted to apply a modified version of this law to bacterial growth by replacing the reaction rate constant by the growth rate constant, but the modified law relationship fits data poorly, as graphs of the logarithm of the growth rate constant against reciprocal absolute temperature result in curves rather than straight lines. Instead, a linear relationship between the square root of growth rate constant (r) and temperature (T), namely, √r = b(T-T0), where b is the regression coefficient and T0 is a hypothetical temperature which is an intrinsic property of the organism, is proposed and found to apply to the growth of a wide range of bacteria.

abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero ($\mu$=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (p=constant). The model has four parameters: N(o) (Log10 of initial population density), NMAX (Log10 of final population density), tLAG (time when lag phase ends), and tMAX (time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data for Escherichia coli 0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more 'robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of {\~{}}53,000 star-forming galaxies at z {\~{}} 0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (±0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 M☉ h, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 M☉. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the H$\alpha$ luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z {\~{}} 0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 M☉. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity is currently under threat from human population expansion and the required land transformation for shelter and resources. Land transformation, in the form of agriculture or urbanisation is believed to reduce habitats and their resources, increase fragmentation of natural habitats, and increase the likelihood of successful invasion by exotic species. These all affect existing biodiversity, its structure, and the ecosystem services which it provides. In recent years, development from natural and agricultural (mainly sugarcane) land into eco-estates (housing developments with the intention of conserving the environment) has become increasingly popular along the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. However, research on their impacts on the local environment is limited. We predicted that these eco-estates are, by their design, improving the functional diversity of amphibians, birds, and mammals, and ultimately ecosystem functioning. A multi-taxa assessment of the three components of functional diversity (functional richness, functional evenness, and functional divergence) suggested that eco-estate development was improving certain components for each of the taxa assessed. However, the management and development of these eco-estates was the key determinant. Eco-estates with increased interconnected indigenous forest and thicket/dense bush, with reduced housing and road density, exhibited improved functional diversity in comparison with those more densely inhabited containing isolated natural land-cover patches. We believe that these eco-estates could provide an effective mitigation method of population expansion whilst maintaining ecosystem health, but only under the recommended development and management plans.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

However, recent empirical work has revealed that ecological networks are highly structured, and the lack of a theory that takes into account the structure of interactions precludes further assessment of the implications of such network patterns for biodiversity. Here we use a combination of analytical and empirical approaches to quantify the influence of network architecture on the number of coexisting species. As a case study we consider mutualistic networks between plants and their animal pollinators or seed dispersers. These networks have been found to be highly nested, with the more specialist species interacting only with proper subsets of the species that interact with the more generalist. We show that nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition and enhances the number of coexisting species. Furthermore, we show that a nested network will naturally emerge if new species are more likely to enter the community where they have minimal competitive load. Nested networks seem to occur in many biological and social contexts, suggesting that our results are relevant in a wide range of fields. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

SUMMARY This paper takes a broad, pragmatic view of statistical inference to include all aspects of model formulation. The estimation of model parameters traditionally assumes that a model has a prespecified known form and takes no account of possible uncertainty regarding the model structure. This implicitly assumes the existence of a 'true' model, which many would regard as a fiction. In practice model uncertainty is a fact of life and likely to be more serious than other sources of uncertainty which have received far more attention from statisticians. This is true whether the model is specified on subject-matter grounds or, as is increasingly the case, when a model is formulated, fitted and checked on the same data set in an iterative, interactive way. Modern computing power allows a large number of models to be considered and data-dependent specification searches have become the norm in many areas of statistics. The term data mining may be used in this context when the analyst goes to great lengths to obtain a good fit. This paper reviews the effects of model uncertainty, such as too narrow prediction intervals, and the non-trivial biases in parameter estimates which can follow data-based modelling. Ways of assessing and overcoming the effects of model uncertainty are discussed, including the use of simulation and resampling methods, a Bayesian model averaging approach and collecting additional data wherever possible. Perhaps the main aim of the paper is to ensure that statisticians are aware of the problems and start addressing the issues even if there is no simple, general theoretical fix.},

abstract = {In the process of dredge mining, employed since 1977 on the Zululand coast, heavy minerals are extracted from the dunes after the complete removal of the existing vegetation. The tailings are then reshaped to approximate their original contours, covered with topsoil and revegetated with a cereal cover crop, together with indigenous seeds of long-lived (woody) species. The existence of stands of different ages over a recorded period provided an opportunity to study changes in species composition and vegetation dynamics. Five random 10 × 10m quadrats were sampled in stands of age 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 years respectively, and cover data were used for multivariate analysis using TWINSPAN and DECORANA. Importance values of each species, and total and mean species richness were also calculated. Pre-mined and mined soil samples were analysed for trace elements, organic matter and pH. Recently rehabilitated areas of 4 to 5 years were dominated by Acacia karroo, but species richness showed a progressive increase with age of rehabilitated stands, with more woody species in the older stands and a slight decline in dominance of A. karroo. TWINSPAN classified older and younger stands into distinct groups which were related to a chronological succession gradient, also shown by the DECORANA ordination. Some soil nutrients of rehabilitated areas compared favourably with the pre-mined topsoil and subsoil, but percentage organic matter content was still higher in natural dune forests. Increases in soil nutrients suggest that nutrient retention and the establishment of substantial soil flora and fauna are occurring, providing evidence for the sustainability of the soils. From this study it appears that successional changes follow the facilitation pathway, and rehabilitation will eventually lead to the restoration of the dune forest.},

abstract = {We present a statistical study of a very large sample of HII galaxies taken from the literature. We focus on the differences in several properties between galaxies that show the auroral line [OIII]$\lambda$4363 and those that do not present this feature in their spectra. It turns out that objects without this auroral line are more luminous, are more metal-rich and present a lower ionization degree. The underlying population is found to be much more important for objects without the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 line, and the effective temperature of the ionizing star clusters of galaxies not showing the auroral line is probably lower. We also study the subsample of HII galaxies whose properties most closely resemble the properties of the intermediate-redshift population of luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs). The objects from this subsample are more similar to the objects not showing the [OIII]$\lambda$4363 line. It might therefore be expected that the intermediate-redshift population of LCBGs is powered by very massive, yet somewhat aged, star clusters. The oxygen abundance of LCBGs would be greater than the average oxygen abundance of local HII galaxies.},

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), particularly Lactobacillus plantarum, Weissella viridescens and Lactobacillus sakei, are the main spoilage bacteria of refrigerated, vacuum-packed meat products, stored in modified atmosphere, and their growth determines the shelf life length of these products. The objective of this study was to model the growth of L. plantarum, W. viridescens and L. sakei under different isothermal cultivation conditions and establish secondary models to describe the effect of temperature on the growth parameters of these bacteria. The LAB growth was evaluated in culture medium at temperatures of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 30 °C. The fit of Baranyi and Roberts (BAR) and Gompertz (GO) primary models to the growth curves of LAB was compared by statistical indices, in which the BAR model showed slightly better fits to the experimental data. The BAR growth parameters were used to establish the secondary models, $\mu$max and Nmax were established for the three LAB. The power model described the influence of temperature on the parameter $\lambda$ for L. plantarum, and other bacteria showed no lag phase. The growth of LAB was strongly influenced by storage temperature and the obtained models allow predicting the growth of these bacteria within the temperature range from 4 to 30 °C.},

Despite the recognised importance of biotic factors in determining the invasiveness of microbial communities, the success and impact of multiple concurrent invaders on the resident community has not been examined. Simultaneous invasions might have synergistic effects, for example if resident species need to exhibit divergent phenotypes to compete with the invasive populations. We used three phylogenetically diverse bacterial species to invade two compositionally distinct communities in a controlled, naturalised in vitro system. By initiating the invader introductions at different stages of succession, we could disentangle the relative importance of resident community structure, invader diversity and time pre-invasion. Our results indicate that multiple invaders increase overall invasion success, but do not alter the successional trajectory of the whole community.},

Environmental filtering tends to increase the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait convergence, whereas competition tends to limit the functional similarity of species within communities leading to trait divergence. Here, we introduce a new hierarchical Bayesian model that incorporates intraspecific trait variation into a predictive framework to unify classic coexistence theory and evolutionary biology with recent trait-based approaches. Model predictions exhibited a significant positive correlation (r = 0.66) with observed relative abundances along a 10 °C gradient in mean annual temperature. The model predicted the correct dominant species in half of the plots, and accurately reproduced species' temperature optimums. The framework is generalizable to any ecosystem as it can accommodate any species pool, any set of functional traits and multiple environmental gradients, and it eliminates some of the criticisms associated with recent trait-based community assembly models.},

New data come from MaNGA - we release 4824 datacubes, as well as the first stellar spectra in the MaNGA Stellar Library (MaStar), the first set of survey-supported analysis products (e.g. stellar and gas kinematics, emission line, and other maps) from the MaNGA Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP), and a new data visualisation and access tool we call "Marvin". The next data release, DR16, will include new data from both APOGEE-2 and eBOSS; those surveys release no new data here, but we document updates and corrections to their data processing pipelines. The release is cumulative; it also includes the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since first light. In this paper we describe the location and format of the data and tools and cite technical references describing how it was obtained and processed. The SDSS website (www.sdss.org) has also been updated, providing links to data downloads, tutorials and examples of data use.

In a certain group of chemoautotrophs, the reductive citric acid cycle is an engine of synthesis, taking in CO2 and synthesizing the molecules of the cycle. We have examined the chemistry of a model system of C, H, and O that starts with carbon dioxide and reductants and uses redox couples as the energy source. To inquire into the reaction networks that might emerge, we start with the largest available database of organic molecules, Beilstein on- line, and prune by a set of physical and chemical constraints applicable to the model system. From the 3.5 million entries in Beilstein we emerge with 153 molecules that contain all 11 members of the reductive citric acid cycle. A small number of selection rules generates a very constrained subset, suggesting that this is the type of reaction model that will prove useful in the study of biogenesis. The model indicates that the metabolism shown in the universal chart of pathways may be central to the origin of life, is emergent from organic chemistry, and may be unique.},

Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quan-titatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption line indices, the 4000 Angstrom break strength and the Balmer absorption line index Hdelta{\_}A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122,208 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95{\%} confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is +-40{\%}. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric pass-band and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000 Angstrom break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have stellar masses $\backslash${\~{}}5$\backslash$times 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sol, half light radii {\~{}}3 kpc, and half- light surface mass densities {\~{}}10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sol/kpc{\^{}}2.

The majority of the star formation in the low redshift universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (10{\^{}}10-10{\^{}}11 Msun), typically in HSB disk galaxies. Roughly 15{\%} of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20{\%} occurs in starburst galaxies. We show that the present to past-average star formation rate, the Scalo b-parameter; is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10 Msun. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408{\^{}}{\{}+0.005{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.002{\}} (rand).{\^{}}{\{}+0.029{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.090{\}} (sys.) h70{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}.

In agreement with other work we find a correlation between {\$}b{\$} and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000AA break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {Template UV-optical spectra of quiescent and starburst galaxies are presented and used to derive K-corrections as a function of morphological type and redshift. IUE observations and archival data are used for the UV template spectra. The optical spectra are from ground-based observations obtained in apertures that match closely the 200 arcsec{\^{}}2{\^{}} IUE aperture. The templates of quiescent galaxies are built according to morphological type, elliptical, bulge, S0, Sa, Sb, and Sc, and the templates of starburst galaxies according to color excess. The unprecedented characteristics of these templates is that UV and optical spectra have been obtained in matched apertures to produce consistent spectral information from 1200 to 10,000 A, Despite the relatively small IUE aperture, the galaxy stellar populations are well represented in the elliptical, S0, Sa, and Sc, and in the starburst templates. The spectra are available digitally. The UV-optical templates can be applied to the classification of high- redshift galaxies and to the identification of the host galaxies of quasars. The templates predict that observed magnitudes from traditional ground-based photometric surveys can be uniquely interpreted. For example, U, B, and I magnitudes uniquely determine both the redshift and the morphological type of a galaxy. The template spectra are also used to calculate K-corrections for galaxies as a function of morphological type and redshift, up to z = 2. These improved K-corrections are not sufficient to explain the excess counts in faint blue galaxies. A subset of our galaxy templates are linked with published data from the radio to the X-ray for galaxies and quasars. A comparison between the quiescent galaxies and the quasars suggests that, in the optical band, the host galaxy is a factor of 10-100 fainter in flux than the quasar.},

To predict the number of organisms as a function of temperature and time, it is essential to model the growth as a function of temperature. The temperature is often not constant in various stages of distribution. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of shifts in temperature. The suitability and usefulness of several models to describe the growth of Lactobacillus plantarum with fluctuating temperatures was evaluated. It can be assumed that temperature shifts within the lag phase can be handled by adding relative parts of the lag time to be completed and that temperature shifts within the exponential phase result in no lag phase. With these assumptions, the kinetic behavior of temperature shift experiments was reasonably well predicted, and this hypothesis was accepted statistically in 73{\%} of the cases. Only shifts of temperature around the minimum temperature for growth showed very large deviations from the model prediction. The best results were obtained with the assumption that a temperature shift (within the lag phase as well as within the exponential phase) results in an additional lag phase. This hypothesis was accepted statistically in 93{\%} of the cases. The length of the additional lag phase is one-fourth of the lag time normally found at the temperature after the shift.},

The number of spoilage bacteria present when stored at 35 °C was significantly greater than when stored at lower temperatures, and maximum population size was achieved after 10 h. However, Bacillus pumilus, Dickeya zeae, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. Carotovorum Pcc21, and Bacillus pumilus (RDA-R) did not grow at the storage temperature of 5 °C. The biofilm formation by Clavibacter michiganensis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and A. calcoaceticus (RDA-R) are higher than other spoilage bacteria. Biofilm formation showed low correlation between hydrophobicity, and no significant correlation with colony spreading. These results might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures, and could be basic information on the growth characteristics and biofilm formation properties of spoilage bacteria from fresh produce. Practical Application: Growth of spoilage bacteria was different depending on the bacteria strains and storage temperature. Between biofilm formation and cell hydrophobicity was low correlation on spoilage bacteria. Therefore, growth characteristics and biofilm formation of spoilage bacteria might be used for developing safe storage guidelines for fresh produce at various storage temperatures.},

A proposed phenomenological model composed of a decay factor superimposed on a growth term can describe both. Temperature elevation shortens the two subprocesses' characteristic times and increases their rates. The degradation's characteristic time relative to the experiment's determines whether a peak is observed. All of the parameters determine the peak's height and shape as can be seen in two interactive Wolfram demonstrations on the Web. Detailed knowledge of the underlying mechanisms is unnecessary for the model's construction, and uniqueness is not a prerequisite either. However, different expressions might be needed for ongoing processes and ones initially undetectable. The model's applicability is demonstrated with published results on very different reactions in foods. In principle, it can be converted into a dynamic rate equation for simulating a process's evolution under non-isothermal conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Do communities return to their former state when we disturb them? The answer is “surely not always,” since some disturbances may be so devastating that recovery will be impossible. If communities do recover, then how fast is that recovery? Do different subsets of species return at the same rate? Is that rate a simple exponential recovery— meaning that the change toward the original state is fastest when the community is furthest away and it slows as the community converges? Or is recovery a more dynamically complex process? These questions are theoretically interesting and practically important. The theoretical questions are if there is a particular state—some exact composition—to which a community is likely to return, if there might be several (or many) possible such states, or if community composition is essentially haphazard. The practical implication is that if disturbed ecological communities do not tend to return to a previous state, it may be impossible to undo human impacts on natural ecosystems. We follow the fate of species assemblages following the removal of vegetation for mining. We show that these assemblages in restored subtropical coastal dune forests in South Africa do converge with a regional equilibrium state and that convergence is possible within a reasonable period. However, changes in assemblages from different trophic levels were idiosyncratic: convergence in the dung beetle assemblage did not mimic convergence for trees and birds, for example. Few of the assemblages converged exponentially, the simplest shape for the decay function. Furthermore, trends were sometimes different for different indices of community dissimilarity, suggesting that whether one accepts convergence depends, in part, on exactly what one measures.},

Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

Models depict biological processes in simplified and general ways that provide insight into factors that are responsible for observed patterns.

Model selection is underpinned by a philosophical view that understanding can best be approached by simultaneously weighing evidence for multiple working hypotheses.

The dominant paradigm is to generate a null hypothesis (typically one with little biological menaing) and ask whether the hypothesis can be rejected in light of observed data. Rejection occurs when an test statistic generated from observed data falls beyond an arbitrary probability threshold (usually P{\textless}0.05) which is interpreted as tacit support for a biologically more meaningful alternative hypothesis. Hence, the actual hypothesis of interest (the alternative hypothesis) is accepted only in the sense that the null hypothesis is rejected.},

In order to achieve certain conservation goals it will be necessary to have in place a variety of different types of management ranging from non- or minimal intervention through to intensive single species management and habitat re-creation. However, it will not provide a comprehensive framework for all aspects of site management, but only those that are deemed to be of strategic importance, and have significance within an all-Wales perspective for their nature conservation importance.},

abstract = {This paper summarises recent trends in predictive modelling of microbial lag phenomena. The lag phase is approached from both a qualitative and a quantitative point of view. First, a definition of lag and an analysis of the prevailing measuring techniques for the determination of lag time is presented. Furthermore, based on experimental results presented in literature, factors influencing the lag phase are discussed. Major modelling approaches concerning lag phase estimation are critically assessed. In predictive microbiology, a two-step modelling approach is used. Primary models describe the evolution of microbial numbers with time and can be subdivided into deterministic and stochastic models. Primary deterministic models, e.g., Baranyi and Roberts [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 23 (1994) 277], Hills and Wright [J. Theor. Biol. 168 (1994) 31] and McKellar [Int. J. Food Microbiol. 36 (1997) 179], describe the evolution of microorganisms, using one single (deterministic) set of model parameters. In stochastic models, e.g., Buchanan et al. [Food Microbiol. 14 (1997) 313], Baranyi [J. Theor. Biol. 192 (1998) 403] and McKellar [J. Appl. Microbiol. 90 (2001) 407], the model parameters are distributed or random variables. Secondary models describe the relation between primary model parameters and influencing factors (e.g., environmental conditions). This survey mainly focusses on the influence of temperature and culture history on the lag phase during growth of bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The design (synthesis) of analog electrical circuits starts with a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior and requires creating a circuit that satisfies the specified design goals. Analog circuit synthesis entails the creation of both the topology and the sizing (numerical values) of all of the circuit's components. The difficulty of the problem of analog circuit synthesis is well known, and there is no previously known general automated technique for synthesizing an analog circuit from a high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior. This paper presents a single uniform approach using genetic programming for the automatic synthesis of both the topology and sizing of a suite of eight different prototypical analog circuits, including a lowpass filter, a crossover (woofer and tweeter) filter, a source identification circuit, an amplifier, a computational circuit, a time-optimal controller circuit, a temperature-sensing circuit, and a voltage reference circuit. The problem-specific information required for each of the eight problems is minimal and consists of the number of inputs and outputs of the desired circuit, the types of available components, and a fitness measure that restates the high-level statement of the circuit's desired behavior as a measurable mathematical quantity. The eight genetically evolved circuits constitute an instance of an evolutionary computation technique producing results on a task that is usually thought of as requiring human intelligence. The fact that a single uniform approach yielded a satisfactory design for each of the eight circuits as well as that a satisfactory design was created on the first or second run of each problem are evidence for the general applicability of genetic programming for solving the problem of automatic synthesis of analog electrical circuits. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

abstract = {This study proposes and discusses a multi-scale spatial planning method implemented simultaneously at local and national level to prioritize ecosystem management actions across landscapes and seascapes. Mismatches in scale between the occurrence of biodiversity patterns and ecological processes, and the size and nature of the human footprint, and the different levels and scope of governance, are a significant challenge in conservation planning. These scale mismatches are further confounded by data resolution disparities across and amongst the different scales. To address this challenge, we developed a multi-resolution scale-linked marine spatial planning method. We tested this approach in the development of a Conservation Plan for a significant portion of South Africa's exclusive economic zone, adjacent to the east coast province of KwaZulu-Natal (the SeaPlan project). The study's dataset integrated the geographic distribution of 390 biodiversity elements (species, habitats, and oceanographic processes) and 38 human activities. A multi-resolution system of planning unit layers (PUL), with individual PUs ranging in resolution from 0.2 to 10 km, was designed to arrange and analyse these data. Spatial priorities for conservation were selected incrementally at different scales, contributing conservation targets from the fine-, medium- and large-scale analyses, and from the coast to the offshore. Compared to a basic single-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our multi-resolution scale-linked method selects 6{\%} less conservation area to achieve the same targets. Compared to a multi-resolution scale-unlinked plan, our method requires only an additional 5{\%} area. Overall, this method reflects the multi-scale nature of marine social-ecological systems more realistically, is relatively simple and replicable, and serves to better connect fine-scale and large-scale spatial management policies. We discuss the impacts of this study on protected area expansion planning processes in South Africa. This study showcases a methodological advance that has the potential to impact marine spatial planning practices and policies.},

The genus is also known for its aromatic nature and hence research has been focussed on the chemical compositions of the volatile secondary metabolites obtained from various Artemisia species. In the southern African region, A. afra is one of the most popular and commonly used herbal medicines. It is used to treat various ailments ranging from coughs and colds to malaria and diabetes. Although it is one of the most popular local herbal medicines, only limited scientific research, mainly focussing on the volatile secondary metabolites content, has been conducted on this species. The aim of this review was therefore to collect all available scientific literature published on A. afra and combine it into this paper. In this review, a general overview will be given on the morphology, taxonomy and geographical distribution of A. afra. The major focus will however be on the secondary metabolites, mainly the volatile secondary metabolites, which have been identified from this species. In addition all of the reported biological activities of the extracts derived from this species have been included as well as the literature on the pharmacology and toxicology. We aim at bringing together most of the available scientific research conducted on this species, which is currently scattered across various publications, into this review paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 SAAB.},

Growth was determined by measuring dry weight and chlorophyll a, while toxin was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Two of the three toxic cultures studied produced more toxins in axenic than in nonaxenic cultures. High toxin production correlated with high nitrogen concentrations (test range, 0.42 to 84 mg of N per liter) and low light intensity (test range, 12 to 95 microeinsteins/m2 per s). Toxin production depended on phosphorus concentration at low levels of phosphorus (0.1 to 0.4 mg of P per liter) and higher concentrations had no additional effect. The optimum temperature for toxin production and growth of green O. agardhii was 25°C. Red O. agardhii produced almost similar amounts of toxin at temperatures of 15 to 25°C. The lowest toxin production by both strains was at 30°C.},

Ovipositional and developmental rate functions were used in a temperature-driven, discrete-time, simulation model describing McDaniel spider mite population dynamics. Temperature dependence of the instantaneous population growth rate was determined by fitting the derived rate-temperature function to data generated through simulation at various fixed temperatures. The functional relationship of important population parameters to temperature provided the mechanism for inclusion of phenological effects on mite populations in a synoptic apple pest management model. Two derived functions were fit to several published rate-temperature data sets. Adequacy of description (as indicated by R 2 values) indicated general applicability of both functions for description of temperature-controlled, biological processes. Further, it was concluded that the singular perturbation method of matched asymptotes has potentially wide application in ecology, and an Appendix detailing the application of this method is included.},

abstract = {Most of the models of microbial growth in food are Empirical algebraic, of which the Gompertz model is the most notable, Rate equations, mostly variants of the Verhulst's logistic model, or Population Dynamics models, which can be deterministic and continuous or stochastic and discrete. The models of the first two kinds only address net growth and hence cannot account for cell mortality that can occur at any phase of the growth. Almost invariably, several alternative models of all three types can describe the same set of experimental growth data. This lack of uniqueness is by itself a reason to question any mechanistic interpretation of growth parameters obtained by curve fitting alone. As argued, all the variants of the Verhulst's model, including the Baranyi-Roberts model, are empirical phenomenological models in a rate equation form. None provides any mechanistic insight or has inherent advantage over the others. In principle, models of all three kinds can predict non-isothermal growth patterns from isothermal data. Thus a modeler should choose the simplest and most convenient model for this purpose. There is no reason to assume that the dependence of the "maximum specific growth rate" on temperature, pH, water activity, or other factors follows the original or modified versions of the Arrhenius model, as the success of Ratkowsky's square root model testifies. Most sigmoid isothermal growth curves require three adjustable parameters for their mathematical description and growth curves showing a peak at least four. Although frequently observed, there is no theoretical reason that these growth parameters should always rise and fall in unison in response to changes in external conditions. Thus quantifying the effect of an environmental factor on microbial growth require that all the growth parameters are addressed, not just the "maximum specific growth rate." Different methods to determine the "lag time" often yield different values, demonstrating that it is a poorly defined growth parameter. The combined effect of several factors, such as temperature and pH or a w, need not be "multiplicative" and therefore ought to be revealed experimentally. This might not be always feasible, but keeping the notion in mind will eliminate theoretical assumptions that are hard to confirm. Modern mathematical software allows to model growing or dying microbial populations where cell division and mortality occur simultaneously and can be used to explain how different growth patterns emerge. But at least in the near future, practical problems, like translating a varying temperature into a corresponding microbial growth curve, will be solved with empirical rate models, which despite not being "mechanistic" are perfectly suitable for this purpose. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (pPXF) method, which is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} is smaller than the velocity sampling {\$}\backslashDelta V{\$}, which is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when {\$}\backslashsigma{\textless}\backslashDelta V/2{\$}, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of {\$}\backslashsigma{\$}. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with {\$}\backslashsigma\backslashll\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm inst{\}}{\$}, for galaxy redshift determinations, or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

Other broad-leaved species are establishing themselves in rehabilitating areas more than 12 years of age. Soils from rehabilitating stands 3–5, 9–12, 13–15, and 16–18 years of age, from two disturbed, unmined stands 30 and 58 years of age, and from a mature unmined stand were examined to assess age-related trends in selected soil properties. Individually, these stands represent a series of different developmental stages of a coastal dune successional sere. Soil organic material, percentage organic carbon and concentrations of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and nitrogen increased with an increase in habitat regeneration age. Concentrations of most of these elements were lower than those recorded on the 58-year-old unmined and mature unmined stands. Multivariate analyses suggest, however, that the similarity of these values for rehabilitating stands to those for the unmined stands increased with an increase in regeneration age. The growth response of Raphanus sativus (radish) plants, based on mass attained under experimental growing conditions in soil collected from these stands, suggests an increase in soil fertility with an increase in regeneration age.},

Mendel's laws of inheritance and the subsequent work on genes may well form the beginning of such a theory as far as biology is concerned. Furthermore,, it is quite possible that an abstract argument can be found which shows that there is a conflict between such a theory and the accepted principles of physics. The argument could be of such abstract nature that it might not be possible to resolve the conflict, in favor of one or of the other theory, by an experiment. Such a situation would put a heavy strain on our faith in our theories and on our belief in the reality of the concepts which we form. It would give us a deep sense of frustration in our search for what I called "the ultimate truth." The reason that such a situation is conceivable is that, fundamentally, we do not know why our theories work so well. Hence, their accuracy may not prove their truth and consistency. Indeed, it is this writer's belief that something rather akin to the situation which was described above exists if the present laws of heredity and of physics are confronted.},

abstract = {We perform a spectroscopic analysis of 492,450 galaxy spectra from the first two years of observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III/Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. This data set has been released in the ninth SDSS data release, the first public data release of BOSS spectra. We show that the typical signal-to-noise ratio of BOSS spectra is sufficient to measure stellar velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes for individual objects. The typical velocity dispersion of a BOSS galaxy is 240 km/s, with an accuracy of better than 30 per cent for 93 per cent of BOSS galaxies. The distribution in velocity dispersion is redshift independent between redshifts 0.15 and 0.7, which reflects the survey design targeting massive galaxies with an approximately uniform mass distribution in this redshift interval. The majority of BOSS galaxies lack detectable emission lines. We analyse the emission line properties and present diagnostic diagrams using the emission lines [OII], H $\beta$ , [OIII], Halpha, and [NII] (detected in about 4 per cent of the galaxies). We show that the emission line properties are strongly redshift dependent and that there is a clear correlation between observed frame colours and emission line properties. Within in the low- z sample around 0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.3, half of the emission-line galaxies have LINER-like emission line ratios, followed by Seyfert-AGN dominated spectra, and only a small fraction of a few per cent are purely star forming galaxies. AGN and LINER-like objects, instead, are less prevalent in the high- z sample around 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7, where more than half of the emission line objects are star forming. This is a pure selection effect caused by the non-detection of weak H $\beta$ emission lines in the BOSS spectra. Finally, we show that star forming, AGN and emission line free galaxies are well separated in the g - r vs r - i target selection diagram.},
