#Continuity of the thermal optimum in mesophilic and psichrophilic Arthrobacter species. A multimodel inference approach

##This folder contains the components necessary to smoothly run the mini-project. It contains 4 subfolders:

### Code

The requirements to run the contents of this folder are detailed next. 
1. For Python, there are only two non regular packages that need to be installed: ProgresBar, which implements a progressbar during the execution of the code, and lmfit, which performs the NLLS fitting.
2. For R, ggplot, grid, and gridExtra are necessary to generate the plots in the report.
3. LaTeX y Bash must also be installed.

Next, we list the contents on each folder, and their functionalyti

1. Scripts for data preparation; data_preparation_1.R , data_preparation_2.R and data_preparation_functions.R
2. Scripts for NLLS fitting: fit_store_results_1.py and fit_store_results_2.py, and script to store the fitted models: models.py
3. Scripts for plotting: plotting_1.R and plotting_2.R
4. Script to run all the above: run_MiniProject.sh
5. Script to genarate LaTeX report: mini_project_report.tex
6. Script to generate references in LaTeX: library.bib
