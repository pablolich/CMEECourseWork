# Week 2 README

This folder contains three subfolders: Data, were we store the data used in our code; Code, were we have the writen code; and Sandbox, were we store everything that is not Data or Code.

## Code


1. `align_seqs.py`: Calculates the best alignment between 2 genomes
2. `align_seqs_fasta.py`: Applies align_seqs.py to two fasta input files. If no 
			files are given, takes default ones.
3. `align_seqs_better.py`: Adds to align_seqs_fasta.py the ability to save all the best alignmets to different output files
4. `basic_csv.py`: running and saving csv files in python
5. `basic_io1.py`, 
6. `basic_io2.py`, 
7. `basic_io3.py`: Dealing with different options to save content to files
8. `boilerplate.py`: ilustrates the concept of if `(__name__ == '__main__'):` and 
			the conveniences of having a def(main) function.
9. `cfexercises1.py`: first program in python.
10. `cfexercises2.py`: control flow and division exercises
11. `control_flow.py`: more control flow exercises
12. `debugme.py`: learning how to use import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace(context = 20)
13. `dictionary.py`: exercise dealing with populating dictionaries
14. `lc1.py`, 
15. `lc2.py`: exercises dealing with list comprehensions
16. `loops.py`: learning what loops in python are
17. `oaks.py`: Finds just those taxa that are oak trees from a list of species
18. `oaks_debugme.py`: Finds just those taxa that are oak trees from a list of species and accepts typos
19. `scope.py`: dealing with global and local variables
20. `sysargv.py`: understanding what the deal is with sys.argv
21. `test_control_flow.py`: learning what doctest() does
22. `tuple.py`: learning how to print information in tuples
23. `using_name.py`: learning what `if (__name__ == '__main__'):` does
