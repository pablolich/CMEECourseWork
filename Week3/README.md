WEEK 3 README

This folder contains three subfolders: Data, were we store the data used in our code;
Code, were we have the writen code; Sandbox, were we store everything that is not
Data or Code; and Results, where all the results of our code go to.

FILES INSIDE CODE FOLDER

	1. DataWrang.R: Wranlging Data in R
	2. DataWrangTidi.R: Wrangling Data with the packages dplyr and tidyr
	3. GPDD_Data.R: Represents on a world map data from location in which we have species information.
	4. Girko.R: Graphical demonstration of Girkos's law
	5. MyBars.R: Anotating in ggplot2
	6. PP_Lattice.R: Using Lattice to create panels with multiple plots. Also returns a table with several calculations performed in the different groups.
	7. PP_Regress.R: A file that reproduces the plot in the notes and outputs it to results, as well as a table with fit data for every performed fit.
	8. PP_Regress_loc.R: The same file, but the groups to fit are formed taking into account this time also the location of the species.  
	9. Ricker.R: Deals with the Ricker model, and draws a plot of the population evolution based on this model
	10. TAutoCorr.R: Are temperatures of one year significantly correlated with the next year (successive years), across years in a given location?
 	11. TAutoCorr_Results.tex: Code file generator of the latex document
	12. Treeheight.R: This script loads the treeheights file with the heights of trees g and calculates the height of each tree based on its distance and inclination degrees
	13. Vectorize1.R: Example of vectorization
	14. Vecotrize2.R: Runs the Ricker Stochastic model and performs a vectorization of it to compare the increase in speed. 
	15. apply1.R: Learning how to use apply function.
	16. apply2.R: This function multiplies the elements of a vector by 100 if their sum is greater than 0. Otherwise, it just returns the vector
	17. basic_io.R: A simple script to ilustrate R input-output 
	18. boilerplate.R: A boilerplate R script.
	19. break.R: Ilustrate how the break command works
	20. browse.R: Demonstrates how browser can be used to debug a function
	21. control_flow.R: Demonstration of control flow statements such as if, for, while... 
	22. get_TreeHeigt.R:  This script loads the a file with the heights of trees that the user inputs and calculates the height of each tree based on its distance and inclination degrees  using  the trigonometric formula 
	23. get_TreeHeight.py: Python version of get_TreeHeight.R
	24. next.R: Demonstrates the use of the command next.
	25. plotLin.R: Annotating in plots with ggplot2
	26. preallocate.R Demonstrates how prealocation increases speed.
	27. run_get_TreeHeight.sh: Runs get_TreeHeight.R and get_TreeHeight.py with trees.csv as an example. Shows the results in the screen
	28. sample.R: Showing how vectorized ways and tapply functions are faster than loops
	29. try.R: Demonstrates how the try command works
	30. Vectorize1.py: python version of Vectorize1.R
	31. Vectorize2.py: python version of Vectorize2.R
	32. run_vectorize.sh: bash script that compares the velocities of all the vectorize files.
