This folder contains three subfolders: Data, were we store the data used in our code; Code, were we have the writen code; and Sandbox, were we store everything that is not Data or Code.

## Biological Data Structures and C
1. The very basics of C programming
2. How to implement C subroutines within R and Python code
3. Memory management techniques for larger applications 
4. Bitwise representations of categorical data (e.g. DNA, amino acid, trait variables)
5. Storing, manipulating, and working with phylogenetic trees: (e.g. pointers and records, edge tables, Newick vs. XML formats, tree traversal operations)
